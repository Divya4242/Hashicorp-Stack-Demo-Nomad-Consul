# Hashicorp-Stack-Demo(Nomad-Consul)

This demonstration showcases a simplified implementation of [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) and [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) for service deployment and discovery. It utilizes a single machine for both Nomad server and client, as well as Consul server and client. Two Docker images are leveraged: a web-frontend built with React and a Node.js backend, both retrieved from Docker Hub. Separate Nomad jobs are defined for the frontend, backend, and an Nginx service for load balancing. Consul acts as the service registry, allowing the Nginx job to discover the frontend and backend services within the Nomad cluster. This setup provides a basic example of how Nomad and Consul can be used to manage and orchestrate containerized applications.

## Familiarity with (not mandatory):

â€¢ Understanding Containerization (Docker)

â€¢ Service Orchestration Fundamentals (Kubernetes)

â€¢ Basic Networking Knowledge

## Installation

### Nomad

1. **Download and Install Nomad**:
   - Visit the [Nomad download page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/install).
   - Choose the appropriate package for your system and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Check Nomad Version**:
   ```bash
   nomad version
   ```

### Consul

1. **Download and Install Consul**:
   - Visit the [Consul download page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/install).
   - Choose the appropriate package for your system and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Check Consul Version**:
   ```bash
   consul version
   ```

## Usage

#### Nomad Server and Client
1. **Run Nomad Client Agent**:
   ```bash
   cd nomad && nohup sudo nomad agent -config client.hcl &
   ```

2. **Run Nomad Server Agent**:
   ```bash
   cd nomad && nohup sudo nomad agent -config server.hcl &
   ```

#### Consul Agent
1. **Run Consul Dev Agent**:
   ```bash
   nohup consul agent -dev -client 0.0.0.0 &
   ```
   
#### Running a Nomad Job
1. **Submit Jobs to Nomad**:
    - Submit the frontend-website(ReactJS) job to Nomad:
   ```bash
    sudo nomad run frontend.nomad.hcl 
   ```
   - Submit the backend-website(NodeJS) job to Nomad:
     (Wait a few seconds for the above job to become healthy before running the next command.)
   ```bash
    sudo nomad run backend.nomad.hcl 
   ```  
   - Submit the nginx job to Nomad:
     (Wait a few seconds for the above job to become healthy before running the next command.)
   ```bash
    sudo nomad run nginx.nomad.hcl 
   ```
